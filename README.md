# KaraxSP: easy way to deal with Karax

KaraxSP is a simple CLI to create and compile a Karax project.
At this point is very basic, but I plan to add some great features in the future.

# Compilation and installation
- Install the requirements: `nimble requirements`
- Compile KaraxSP: `nim c karaxsp`
- Copy the `karaxsp` folder into your home directory (on Windows is `%USERPROFILE%` while on Linux is `$HOME`)
- Profit

# Usage
- To create a project: `./karaxsp init`
- To compile a project: `./karaxsp compile`
